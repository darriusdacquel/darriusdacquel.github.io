My passion lies in solving problems through code, whether it's optimizing algorithms, designing interactive user experiences, or developing creative solutions for research. Outside of academics, I enjoy video editing, weight lifting, cooking, gaming, and practicing piano—it keeps life as balanced as my code!",
